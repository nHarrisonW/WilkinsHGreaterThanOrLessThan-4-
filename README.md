GitHub Project Part 4 - GREATER, LESS THAN, OR EQUAL TO
this project will compare two different numbers declared by the user and will let the user know which number is greater than the other, or if they are equal too


Peer reviewed by Amardeep Mann: Good work! Code works great. I enjoyed the all-caps vibe- made me laugh for sure. Good use of number validation for the number responses. Input validation works for both strings and decimals. Good accounting for edge cases with both the user responses of "y" or "Y" playing-again. Try parse works great and code is super readable
