Peer reviewed by Amardeep Mann: Good work! Code works great. I enjoyed the all-caps vibe- made me laugh for sure. Good use of number validation for the number responses. Input validation works for both strings and decimals. Good accounting for edge cases with both the user responses of "y" or "Y" playing-again. Try parse works great and code is super readable
